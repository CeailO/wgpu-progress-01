# WGPU Progress

I know that I'm the worst in turning project into some naming conventions. But alas, this is something I would like to dedicate myself to learn low-level api which sounding worth.
I had thought to abandon ggez as for now.

Todo!

[x] Direct X 12

[] Vulkan

[] Metal

~~[] Direct X 11 (abandoned)~~

[x] Wgsl shader and buffer

[] Documentation

[] Learn damn math

Priority still will continue the rust-basic-101 for refreshing mind.
